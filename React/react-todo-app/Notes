Thinking in React  - Todo-App

step-1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

App
    - Header
        - TodoTextInput
    - MainSection
        - TodoItem(s)
    - Footer


step-2 : Build A Static Version in React    

Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

    a.Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
    b.Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.
    c.Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.


    e.g

    state ==> list of todos 


Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

     e.g for todo-app       

       App ==> stateful
